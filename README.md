# HandsyFace
Garmin watch face using hands instead of numbers. the hands start at 12 o clock and traverses around the screen as regular watch hands. In the middle, the date is displayed. There are four watch hands, from the outside in:

#### Time hand
Displays the current time the same way a regular hour hand on a watch does. You can see the time with what's usually enough precision, basically every 15 minutes or so.

#### Activity hand
Shows how close you are to your set activity goal for the week. *Note that the goal is at 6 o clock (the bottom of the screen) to accomodate and encourage continous improvement.*

#### Calories hand
Shows how many calories you have burned during the day. Due to not figuring out the settings system and not having enough energy to research more, a goal is compiled in. It is currently set to 1500 above average MBR (2000 kcal).  *Note that the goal is at 6 o clock (the bottom of the screen) to accomodate and encourage continous improvement.*

#### Steps hand
Shows how close you are to reaching the step goal for the day. *Note that the goal is at 6 o clock (the bottom of the screen) to accomodate and encourage continous improvement.*

Very simple, and reasonably clean. Not sure if I like it yet.

## Installation instructions
There are two main ways to install this watchface

### Pre built binary
Connect your device to the computer and drop the correct binary for your device in the /GARMIN/APPS-folder. 

### Compile from source
Compile it from source using the [Garmin SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/)

If you need to resize the icons there is a script for this in the resources/drawables-folder called [renderImages](https://github.com/knewg/HandsyFace/blob/master/resources/drawables/renderImages). This script can be used to render images in any size. Keep in mind that the different icons have different visual impacts, so a slight modification to the script might be needed for sizes other than 15, or 20px. The script automatically updates [drawables.xml](https://github.com/knewg/HandsyFace/blob/master/resources/drawables/drawables.xml).

After using the "build for device wizard", transfer the built binary per the instructions above.

Note: If you are changing the colors, remember to update the drawables file aswell, since garmin does not allow you to repaint icons in run time.

## Known limitations
I did not bother to figure out a reasonable way to handle "rollaround", i.e. when you reach more than double your goals. Right now it will just look wrap around. I might do something about this in the future.
